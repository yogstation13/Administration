    <p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">For additional clarifications on how the rules are enforced, see <a href="https://forums.yogstation.net/index.php?threads/the-yogstation-codex.15314/#post-139288">the Codex</a>.</span></strong></p><br>
    <p style="text-align:center"><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Common rules:</span></strong></p><br>
    <div style="font-size:14px">
        <strong>
            <span style="color:red">0.0: Don't be a dick.</span> Don't behave in a manner that goes out of its way to deprive the enjoyment of others. These rules are not an exhaustive list. Rules-lawyering is strongly discouraged. If an admin asks you to knock something off, 'well it's not in the rules' is not really an argument.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.1: Don't be a bigot.</span> We expect our players to be tolerant to people who are different from them in some way, and respect their choices. Do not use terminology that is considered bigoted or racist, or is offensive to a large group of people. Usage of the words “nigger”, “faggot”, and derivatives of those are completely banned from the server.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.2: Erotic content is forbidden.</span> As a general rule, anything more sexualized than kissing and hugging is considered erotic. Do not roleplay acts of an erotic nature. Insulting people with erotic or intercourse related terms is fine as long as the insults are not graphic or explained in detail. Do not write, upload, or distribute pornographic literature.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.3: Do not mix IC (in character) and OOC (out of character) knowledge.</span> Do not post information related to a round in progress in the OOC chat. A person reading the OOC chat should not be able to know what's happening in a round, whether anyone is dead, etc. Do not use information your character would have no way of knowing in game. We have a zero-tolerance policy on this, it doesn’t matter how small or insignificant you think it is. Avoid using OOC terminology in character, but if it is necessary, use LOOC. Posting fake IC information in the OOC chat will be classed as breaking this rule.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.4: Do not metacommunicate or multikey</span> You are only allowed to participate on this server on a single BYOND account. Do not try to join with a different account to continue playing. Only use in-game means of communication to discuss in-game events.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.5: Do not spam or advertise.</span><br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.6: Use proper IC language.</span> We are an English speaking community. Using any language other than English in either IC or OOC will be treated as metacommunications, as our admins cannot translate all languages. Do not use netspeak, emoticons, or internet memes in vocal IC communication.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.7: Listen to admins.</span> All cases are subject to admin discretion. If you cannot be contacted, you may be banned to have you explain your part of the story on the forums. Ignoring admin PMs, lying, insulting admins or other players, or showing a general bad attitude will be counted against you and could lead to a ban.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">0.8: Do not abuse macros or autoclickers</span> to gain an unfair advantage. Do not abuse bugs.<br><br>

    <div style="font-size:14px">
        <strong>
            <span style="color:red">1.1: Do not grief.</span> If you are not a round antagonist, do not cause major station damage, cause major chaos, create fires or hull breaches, release harmful gasses, spread harmful diseases, severely harm, decapitate, or murder people, trap people in places from which they cannot escape, or any other action that would be considering agonizing for other players. As a cyborg with an Asimov lawset, following this rule is mandatory towards non-human players. As a rule of thumb, don’t commit crimes worthy of capital punishment as a non-antagonist.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.2: Do not greytide.</span> Do not break windows to space, electrify doors, steal important items or attack or rob random people, especially those that are AFK or braindead. Do not vandalize areas or break lights excessively. Do not block public hallways. Do not deconstruct shuttle chairs. Do not disrupt security for your own enjoyment. For antagonists, the murderboning rule applies instead.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.3: If you acquire guns or magical items as a crewmember during a wizard round and you are not given any objectives by the game, do not use the given items for killing, griefing or greytiding.</span>. For people who are given objectives, the murderbone rule applies instead.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.4: Do not powergame.</span> As a regular crew member, you're not an experienced soldier, nor do you know all the jobs of the station. Do not hunt down criminals as a regular crew member, that’s security’s job. Do not rush into danger without a good reason to do so. Do not collect dangerous items, weapons, rare tools "just in case". Use reasonable self-defense; do not try to kill your attacker in revenge, especially after conflict has already ended. Do not call the escape shuttle without a proper reason, and do not recall it or early-launch it needlessly. This rule does not apply to antagonists.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.5: Do not metagame.</span> Your character does not know everything you do. You should not know the nature of traitor items (see the metashield guide below). This rule does not apply to antagonists.<br><br>

            <p>Definition of 'Spotting': Blood runes, cult dagger, clockwork slabs, clockworks structures, traitor items not in the "stealthy" uplink categories, blatant and obvious changeling abilities(transformation, armblades), any blatant and obvious vampire abilties/features (deathly pale, invisiblity, hypnotism, blood sucking, etc.) revolution flashers, revolution flash hijackers, and shadowlings themselves are all valid items/objects/people to spot a certain antagonist. Until an antagonist is spotted, you may not metagame their items or abilities in order to powergame your way through detecting them before they make a mistake.</p><br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.6: Use a realistic name.</span> Human characters should have at least a first and a last name. Obscene names or names that are similar in look or pronunciation to obscene phrases are strictly forbidden. Do not give cyborgs or bots obscene names. Avoid using famous names or names of other fictional characters. Do not include honorifics in your name. Clowns, Mimes and Wizards are somewhat exempt from this rule but are not exempt from obscene names.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.7: Demonstrate Clone Memory Disorder.</span>. If your character returns from the dead via cloning or cyborgization, they should not remember anything related to their death and absolutely nothing they saw after they died. You retain your memories if you are revived by defibrillation or magic. If you get to return to a round as a different character, such as a personal AI, drone, adamantine golem, animal, space ninja, lavaland character, etc., you should not remember anything that happened before you became that new character. On the other hand, if the character had their brain removed while they were alive, as either a humanoid or cyborg, or had their soul taken with a soulstone, they retain all memories of their life.<br><br>
            <span style="color:red">1.8: Pick roles that you actually intend to play.</span>  Do not repeatedly commit suicide at roundstart when playing any job with limited slots. This may result in a ban. Assistants and tourists are exempt from this rule.<br><br>

            <span style="color:goldenrod"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:16px">Antagonists</span></span></span><br><br>
            <span style="color:goldenrod">2.1.1: Do not murderbone.</span> Do not kill random people for no reason. For individual antagonists (traitors, changelings, Nanotrasen ninjas) murder is allowed if you can justify your actions with a connection to your objectives, which you must explain in detail if questioned. Nuclear teams, wizards, blobs, Syndicate ninjas, traitors with hijack and traitor AIs essentially have an objective to kill everyone and are exempt from most of the rule, however do not spawnkill/convert at Arrivals or render it uninhabitable.<br><br>
            <span style="color:goldenrod">2.1.2: Be active when playing an antagonist role.</span> If you are playing as an antagonist and you need to go AFK or offline, adminhelp to notify admins. If you know you will not be able to stay for a full round, disable the appropriate antagonist preferences.<br><br>
            <span style="color:goldenrod">2.1.3: As a team antagonist</span> (gangster, blood cultist, clockwork cultist, revolutionary, shadowling or thrall) do not attack fellow teammates or deliberately hamper the progress of the team. Listen to your superiors (head revolutionary, head gangster, shadowlings if you are thralled). Do not kill convertable crewmembers for no reason. Do not suicide or ghost during the conversion process.<br><br>
            <span style="color:goldenrod">2.1.4: Be a good abductor.</span> As an abductor, your job is to kidnap people, experiment on them and return them to the station. Therefore do not harm people, unless in self-defense, or teleport them down to a place where they have no way out. Do not loot the Armory, steal/destroy AIs or take people's IDs permanently. Your IDs operate same as the Agent IDs, so you can scan abductees IDs to gain the access with your own ID.<br><br>
            <span style="color:goldenrod">2.1.5: Assimilation hosts should not kill crew members for no reason,</span> unless they have been implanted. Vessels are non-antagonists.<br><br>
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:darkgreen"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-size:16px">Creatures</span></span></span><br><br>
            <span style="color:darkgreen">2.2.1 Rules still apply to creatures.</span>. If you become an animal you keep your antagonist/non-antagonist status. When not antagonist, do not use your new form's abilities to grief. This includes syndicate cyborgs. Do not split as a slime in public places.<br><br>
            <span style="color:darkgreen">2.2.2: The previous rule does not apply to victims of a staff of transformation,</span> instead they may act as the role they are transformed into. Chaos carp bolts are not included in this rule and 2.2.1 applies in such cases.<br><br>
