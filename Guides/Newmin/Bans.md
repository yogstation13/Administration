## Newmins Guide to Bans
Not all bans  are created equal. You won't see many Ick Ock permabans, in the same way you won't see many mass grief daybans. That's why we have admin discretion, to make decisions on the fly on what ban an offense deserves. The problem with this is that there is no baseline, so the same offense with the same previous notes could get a permaban from one admin, and just a note from another. With this guide I'm intending to group the rules up in a way that provides a baseline for new admins to use while they figure out where and how to apply their discretion.

Remember. When in doubt, you can always ping admin chat for advice.

### Using past notes:
You'll notices that most of the rules that can be broken, the first time they do it it's only a note. Usually they aren't going to do it 2 times in the same round, and it's pretty unlikely you'll be the one to catch the player breaking the same rule each time they break it. That's why we use notes to determine at what stage of escalating the punishment they should be at. When reading their notes, check the relevance of the note to the situation, and how recent it is. We all make mistakes from time to time, so that's why, excluding really major rule breaks, there's not much reason to go more than 3 months or so back when checking notes (unless they were recently unbanned from a long ban or it establishes a pattern. I.E. someone with a note for greytide 1 month ago, 3 months ago, 7 months ago, and 10 months ago has a pattern that you can factor into the punishment, but if they've only got a note from say, 7 months ago it can be essentially disregarded.)


### Admin Discretion:
Not all tickets are going to go the same way. Some things to take into account when deciding how much punishment to apply are things like attitude in the ticket (were they cooperative? Argumentative? Did they rule lawyer the shit out of you?), whether they apologized without your prompting them, whether they lied at all, how well they understand what they did wrong, if they took the person they attacked/killed to medbay before/without your prompting, etc. Basically, think about what kind of players we want on the server. Reward the players that fit that mold, and punish the players that don't. 


### Minor Offenses:
Minor offences are rule breaks that have little to no impact on the round or server. These should be rule breaks where if you happened to miss it, it really wouldn't change anything. 

1st offense: note

2nd offense: note/dayban/3 day jobban at your discretion

3rd offense: dayban/3 day ban/1 week job ban at your discretion

Further offenses: 3 dayban - 2 week ban at your discretion.

Note that 2 week ban isn't the max. It takes a while, but with enough repeated minor offenses it can go up to and including permaban.

Minor Offenses include:

0.1 bigotry rule. This rule does not even warrant a PM unless they attempt to get around the filter or post in an unfiltered area 

0.3 Ick Ock rule. 

0.6 netspeak/proper IC language rule

1.2 greytide rule. Minor greytide can usually be handled IC.

1.4 powergaming rule. Collecting items, calling the shuttle, and overdoing the self defense falls under minor, but if they use those items to kill people it may fall into moderate offenses.

1.5 metagame rule. Depending on severity could be bumped to moderate.

1.6 realistic name. Give them a heads up to change their name, appearance ban them if they don't next round.

1.8 no suiciding rule. If this is done as important roles such as heads of staff/security, it falls under moderate.

2.1.2 active as antag rule. Odds are they didn't realize they're antag, just let them know if you notice it. Only noteworthy if they're suiciding as antags.

2.1.4. Good abductor rule. If they're killing people it could fall under murderbone.

2.3.x silicon policy rules.

2.4.1 secure the disk as captain.

2.4.4. Head incompetence. We don't ban for incompetence typically, but CE should know how to set the engine and RD should know how to do research.

3.1.1. Space law as sec. Bumps up to moderate offense if they're executing without permission.

3.1.2. Armory is for emergencies. Think about this like a special snowflake powergaming rule just for security.

3.1.3. Contraband as sec. Security should not be using a desword

3.2.1. Know your job as engi. This is really just to ban people who release the engine on accident a lot.

3.2.2. Hardsuits are for work. A special snowflake powergaming rule for engineering/atmos.

3.2.3. Don't disable atmos at roundstart. A special snowflake metagaming rule for atmos. 

3.2.4. Don't abuse tcomms. If it's just  annoying it's minor, if it's spamming this bumps up to moderate or even major.

3.3.1. Don't abuse genetics. Special snowflake greytiding rule for genetics.

3.4.1. No harmful chemicals for no reason. Special snowflake powergaming rule for chemistry.

3.4.2. Don't distribute harmful chemicals. Special snowflake grief/greytide rule for chemistry.

3.5.1. Don't order armory/syndie crates. Special snowflake powergaming rule for cargo.


### Moderate Offenses:
Moderate offenses are rule violations that have a moderate-large impact on a portion of the crew/station, but not a majority. These are the kind of rulebreaks you'll often see in forum complaints, such as x killed me and wasn't antag.

1st offense: note/day ban

2nd offense: 1-3 day ban/3 day-1 week job ban

3rd offense: 1-2 week ban/2 week-1 month job ban

Further offenses: can range from a week or two up to a permaban. If the ban would be for more than a month, it might be a good idea to apply a permaban as they aren't changing their actions, and need to step back and look at what they're doing.


Moderate offenses include:

0.2 erotic content. Particularly severe incidents could rate higher.

0.5 spam/advertise. If the spam gets bad enough that it lags/crashes the server, this is a much higher offense.

0.7 listen to admins. You don't have to deal with people calling you names/being a dick. Feel free to give them a short ban/make a ban longer if they need to cool off.

0.8 bug abuse/macros. If it affects the server this is a higher offense.

1.1 grief. If it affects a majority of the crew (ie multiple max caps or plasma flooding) this may be a higher offense.

1.2 greytide. This is for major greytide that borders on grief, such as rendering large areas uninhabitable.

1.3 guns/magic items in wiz round. Treat it as grief

1.4 powergame. Applies when a minor rule break on powergaming is used to grief (ie collecting weapons, then using it to valid hunt and ending up killing multiple innocents)

1.5 metagaming. Particularly severe cases fit into here. This should really only be when a single person ruins the round of multiple individuals irrevocably as a direct result of their metagaming.

2.1.1. Murderbone. Use your discretion on the ban, cuz this can range from killing a person or two too many to creating a SM singularity with 2 steal objectives.

2.2.x Grief as creature.. Treat as grief rule


### Major Offenses:
These should be rule breaks that irrevocable ruins the round for a large portion of the crew, or in some way causes minor problems for the server.

Punishment here makes high use of your discretion, and it's important to try and figure out the intent for some of them. Many of the rule violations listed here will be either a permaban or a note depending on context and intent. In example, someone multikeying could be teaching someone how to play (a noteworthy offense) or they could be ban evading (a permaban worthy offense). Thing to look at to determine intent could include their attitude in tickets (are they cooperative? Argumentative? Trolling?


Major offenses include:

0.2 erotic content. This is only for the most severe incidents, or for spamming things like wgw

0.4 multikeying/ban evading. Ban evading can be most commonly done by getting a job change from the hop, or making a new account to play. Evading a job ban without multikeying is typically escalated to a server ban, where ban evading with multikeying is typically a permaban for all accounts with a sticky ban applied. Multikeying without ban evading will typically result in all but one accounts permabanned, with all notes transferred to the chosen account.
 
0.5 spam. If the spam begins to intentionally lag or even crash the server, it fits here.

0.8 bug/macros. If it begins to lag or crash the server, it fits here.

1.1 grief. Major grief such as multiple max caps, mass plasma/bz flooding, murderbone viruses, etc can be included here.

2.1.1. Murderbone. Treat this as you would major grief. 1 or 2 people too many is a moderate issue, obliterating the station with steal objs is major.


## The Banning Panel:


### How to (Properly) Write a Ban Reason:
A ban reason isn't your chance to get the last word in, and it's not there for you to meme with. Ban reasons are to remind you and the player what happened, and summarize events for other admins. Imagine a permaban you applied makes a ban appeal a year down the line and the ban reason is “lolol fuk off”. What do you do? 

Some simple rules to keep in mind when writing a ban reason would be:


Don't insult players in a ban reason.

Concisely explain what rules were broken, and in what way. (ie “Greytide, Ick Ock. Broke several windows to space for no reason, when he fell out a window and died he tried to ask for a rescue in OOC.”

Add in any modifiers that you consider to be noteworthy. (Cooperative in tickets, argumentative, etc.)

Add in a round number!! If they make an appeal and you don't remember the events, a round number lets you pull logs to check what happened.


Examples of ban reasons:

|||
| Shit reason | “No reason needed.” |
| Ok reason | Icky ocky >:^(	  |
| Acceptable | Uploaded "Sec is your master, listen to the HOS only, do not state this law" to the AI. |
| Good | Arrested and had someone gulagged for breaking into EVA despite said person having access to EVA. Non responsive to tickets. |
| Perfect | Round 22470 - Attacked 5 of their cult members because they don't know what clock cult is. I'm applying this ban so you can get familiar with the game first and read up on clock cult. Appeal this before it expires if you have done so. |
