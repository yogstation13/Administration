LIVERLESS LICHDOM
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No longer works, patched, gg
Lose your liver with toxins / 70u mutagen
keep yourself alive with corazone support,
reagents never tick down / activate,
keep traits associated with reagents like speed / stun immunity!
You are now bound to your Corazone blood, make sure you don't run out
remove tox damage beforehand, or it'll be permanent

    Voice-activated Smoke Grenade
Voice-recorder + igniter, hide in starterbox
Wear a bio hood / face-covering mask / internals to be immune to reagents
11 ticks long, 1/10 reagents each tick
 
    5u
Heparin: Guranteed bleedout days later
Crypto: Unable to chase you, but hard to kill
 
    5-200u
Smoke: Same duration, but farther radius at higher u. 15u=3 tiles away, 30u=4, 45u=5, 75u=6, 90u=7, 105u=8
Lube: Slip field for the duration, 10 minimum but lasts longer for each 10u. If noslip boots, add 10u
Chloral: Asleep just as the smoke ends, dead over 40u
Neurotoxin: Asleep a bit after the smoke ends, non-lethal at 80 tox damage and causes brainloss
Sufonal: Asleep long after the smoke clears, or just after 15u chloral
Mutagen: Random mutations at 5u, lethal tox damage at 200u
Tricordizine: 35u is lethal by OD, slight heal before it fully applies
 
    200u
Sugar: 180u + a single patch will knockout anyone in arms reach. Bluespacebeakers = always knockout
 
    Generally:
Kidnap: 30u Smoke, Sugar patches. When they're down, use a sugar patch on them
Kidnap+: 30u Smoke, 15u Perf, Neurotoxin. Reduced to 20 hp and massive brainloss
Kidnap++: 15u Smoke, 20 Perf, Beepsky Smash. They can't move or talk, but look perfectly fine
Permasleep: 30u Smoke, 15u Chloral, Sufonal / Neurotoxin
Suffocate Kill (looks like suicide to crew monitor?): 30u Smoke, 5u Salve, 15u Lexorine
Quick Kill: 30u Smoke, 5u Salve, 15u Lexorine, Tricord
Long Kill: 30u Smoke, 5u Salve, Chloral / Mutagen
Guranteed Kill: 30u Smoke, 5u Salve, 10u Heparin, 40u Tricord, Chloral
Suffer Kill: 30u Smoke, 5u Salve, 50u Crypto, 10u Heparin
 
If autocloning, get Diethylamine, Iodine, Phosphorus, Hydrogen = suicide bomber
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Foam Health Sensor
Helth sensor + igniter, activates when you're crit
?!!! Don't wear a bio hood or other super-bio-prot gear, or it wont work?
!!! BE SURE TO ACTIVATE IT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PACK OR YOU'RE SOL
 
    Healing: Keep a spare, when you've used all your voice ones these remain
15 foam, 25 tricord, 20 ketolane, 20 bicardine, lube = Everyone stunned and fullhealed
15 foam, 25 tricord, 20 ketolane, 20 bicardine, 5 teslum, lube = Same, but +drugs for robots
 
    Revenge: If you have activatable healing ready (ling), wear a biohood and have an emergency deterrant
Any non-c3f / acid death grenade above = Add more smoke than usual = hard to be found and reaches shooters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Landmines
Motion sensor + igniter, or mousetraps + igniter for 0 range / hidden bombs in backpacks
Smokes don't spread into other smoke, but will always spawn a single smoke wherever grenade activates
Meaning if you want double smoke on a single tile, like 400u sugar, set the radius to 0 or use mousetraps
 
Diethylamine, Iodine, Phosphorus, Hydrogen: 200u gibs, 100u kills. 100u kills sec? 200u gibs sec?
Smoke + Salve +
    Anything from above
    C3F: Burns to death at 5u, chance of holes at 100u
    Fluro acid: Melts shit and kills. Has to be 200u, or no effect. Biosuit = minor protection, can run
Smoke + Salve + Sugar x2: Arm to 0 distance, will sugar knockout if they step on the exact square
Foam + C3F: Melts anyone near it, melts all the ground touched, area becomes uninhabitable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pneumatic Cannon
Get pipes under tiles in the crayon room, no need for a RPD
order out is the same as in, so c3f wall melter before others always?
 
? C3F: Melts walls, kills at 100u. Even if they get an extinguisher quick?
? Fluroacid: Melts equiptment, deals damage? how much damage per u?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Spray Bottle
?Does this apply 5u toxin reagents = can be lethal?
? applies more reagents if naked?
? how much reagents applied on full sec gear?
? gas mask makes you immune?
 
Lube
Heparine
?C3F: does a single spray kill a stunned guy?
?Lexorine
Sufonal - Takes a long time, only good for trackable targets

Plant guide
--- Rush toolshed for multitool, or beg from cargo / robo
--- Buy glowshroom ambros pumpkin redbeet nettle : tobacco wheat melon
--- start glowshroom, mutagen it up to 100 in advance for when you add mutagen to it
--- use the rest of the mutagen on gaia pumpkin and redbeet
--- then make mutagen melons with double reagents, then plant and upgrade the rest whenever
--- Decon seeds in DNA machine: Tobacco = Yield 10, Wheat = Production 1, Melon = regrow
--- check strange seeds for special traits or chems when you get passive income $

    Healing (not possible to get all 3 best traits, requires 15 speed on 3 symptoms left)
Spacetorture-only gimmick = coma + resp + spaceheal (-1/-2/0)+ 13 speed = accel + youth + fever/itch
    Works well, perma regen, heals to full after coma
torture/spacewalk comaresp = coma 0/2/-3 + resp 1/-3/-3 + 13 speed + 1 stealth = adapt + youth + feve+shiv
    Can live in space for a very long time w/ no mask. With cuffs = eternal torture but also a good normal heal
Spreading comaresp = same as above only sneeze instead of shiver
    Will be visible = less helpful coma, but easier to spread and can track when its maxed out
### Super NocResp = nocturnal + resp + 12 resist + 13 speed = youth + fever + 5 + 6 = not possible, 1 off
(Vampire) bloody NocResp = nocturnal + resp + 12 resist = sneezing + cough + fever + itch (neuter all but snez)
    Refills blood for near instant regen, 2 people = infinite, heal self in darkness
??? better vamp = resp + nanites + 9 resist + 8 speed = youth 4/4, fever/itch 6/6
    if you can get nanites,
(powergame selfheal) NocComa = coma, nocturnal, youth, vitiligo, fever, itch. Get feve-itch first and neuter
    ? resist, super strong +4 regen in the dark, invis coma???, super fast start time, easyish to make
(nanite powergame selfheal) coma + nanites + noc + 11 speed + 0 stealth = accel + youth + fever
    everything meets the criteria, but the nanite boost seems to only be 0.5?
### test toxconvert=RPT + 11 resist = confirmed doesn't do jack shit
### test griefheal = RPT, sneeze, nocturnal, fever/accel/shiver, 10 speed = can trade shiver fr cough if neuter
    Shows up as bad virus, heals slowly but causes weight loss quickly
 
 
    Nonlethal / Hyph
(grief) Easy Eyeremoval hyph = hyph + 16 resist = hyph + youth + inorgbio + sneeze + cough + fever/itch
    works great, spreads by itself, only need plasma+food+synapt and fever/shiver, ??? cure
(high grief) stealth eyehyph = hyph + 16 resist + 5 stealth = hyph + adapt + youth + sneeze + vitil + headache
    neuter vitil / youth / headache / adapt. Cure is ? = steal chem, but slow to act
(solo target / nontag) hyph + headache + cough + 7 resist + 10 speed = youth + fever + itch
    Stunspam is annoying, hyph removes eyes, 13 resist, neuter itching or its 'lethal'
### brain/eyeremoval hyph = hyph + confuse + 17 resist = hyph + youth + adapt + headache + inorgbio + confuse
    invis, won't spread by itself, but does confusion+brainloss = long term retards. Lipo cure, but slow
    Doesnt cause brainloss, confusion is minor relative to being blind
(high grief if no chem) chemless torture= hyph + deaf + 15 resist = hyph + deaf + youth + head + sneeze + adapt
    ??? cure, perma deafness. if you can steal chem, its fine that hypo isnt eyeloss
### chemless voicehchangegrief = hyph + deaf + voicechange + 18 trans (15 if no deaf) = not possible
    highest trans possible is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2
### Test permatorture = necro + regen coma + 10 speed = necro, regen coma, shiver, fever, itch, ACCEL
    works, but necro is far too slow to catch up to coma, looooong delay and boring
 
    Lethal (but why bother when uranium is better and always present now)
Solo-stealth necro = necro + analg + 3 stealth + 13 resist = yuth3/4/4, itch+feve0/3/3, facial0/3/2
    Works well, fever / itch is loud, but analg makes it so you always seem full hp. Noob killer, ? resist
Solo-speed bleednecro = necro + 11 resist + speed =  youth, head, fever, itch, cough
    ? resist, head / cough stuns, visible and curable and noticable
### Easy Bleedstun necro = necro + all virus food - shiver = necro + sneeze + cough + itch + headache + fever
    bleed gurantees bloodloss even if healed, sneezing = spread
### Stam necro = necro + headche + 4-7 speed + 12 trans = necro + hedche + sneeze + accel + inorgbio +feve/shiv
    even after stam changes doesn't stunlock, damage is low and bleedout is ignorable with brute patches
### test super combust = combust + 12 speed = combust + youth + vitiligo + fever + *head + itch
    quick, invis, 10 damage proc, burns off non-backpack clothes, fever / itch loud, ignorable with meds
### test eternal spreadfire = combust + necrometb + 12 trans=combust + necrometb + sneeze + accel + inorg + fvr
    works, but weak fire. Infect a lotta monkeys beforehand and spread around, but noticable and slow
### test super choke = choke + 10 speed = choke + fever + itch + shiver + headache + sneeze
    eventual lethal, epi stalled
### test baddies = choke + necro + combust + speed = choke + necro + combust + accel + youth + vitil/itch/fever
    Could ignore it as a plant with extinguisher, humans may die. Better with speed only probs
### test speedies = choke + combust + headache + 12 speed = choke + combust + headache + accel + youth + itch
    Could ignore it as a plant with extinguisher, wasnt very fast uptake either
 
    uranium lethal
### test strongchoke+= +choke + 10 trans
    choking was 30-40? damage, knocked me out as soon as lv 5 hit, epi can't save ppl anymore but cpr can?
    10 trans = airborn = spreads even if you have a mask. Even if you're in full bio gear?
### super ++choke = +choke + choke + 11 speed +14 trans = not possible, need 5 symptoms to get 14 trans
### test super ++choke = +choke + choke + 11 speed = that + youth + accel + fever/itch + sneeze
    1-2 minutes to activate, very noticable but downed me quickly
### test strong +combust = +combust + 11 resist =
    looong delay between procs, ~30 damage per proc, had to resist multiple times for each fire, c3f may work
### test greedy +combust = +combust + 11 resist + 10 trans = snez 3/4, fever3/2, cough 3/2, shivr 2/2
    c3f is insta removed, but napalm stacks up long after. 70+ damage even with an extinguisher, can't roll out
### test compare between +necro and speedy +necro
    speedless = no heparine, did ignorable damage with patches and no bloodloss, speedy was eventual lethal  
(solo target) super +necro = +necro + 7 stealth + 6 speed = +necro + youth + vitil + analg + itch + fever
    near instant lvl 5, super fatal levels of damage, loud fever / itch symptoms, super speedy at 14, 6 resist
(murderbone) spread stealth +necro= +necro + youth + vitil + necrometab + sneeze + analg
    9 fast, works on dead, invis even while damaging, 1 resist = ez cure, all lv 5 addons = ez, CURE SELF FIRST
 
 
 
1 = Virus food + synaptizine
2 = Water + Milk
3 = Mutagen + Virus food
4 = Mutagen + Virus food + Sugar
5 = Plasma + Virus food + Synaptizine
6 = Plasma + Virus food
7 = Plasma + Virus food + 5 Uranium
8 = Plasma + 10 uranium + 10 silver / gold
 
nocturnal doesnt heal in space
halu sucks
dizzy weak as fuck, though it does actually make you dizzy slightly in tgyog
shiver is weak as shit, didn't even slow me down
same with fever
choke+ chems do nothing, are long term sleep / stunners but only 3u injected
narco pretty shitty, only asleep for 4-5 seconds with heavy sleeper after 5 min, headache is more debilitating
itching did minor damage to monkeys over a very long time, but none to me a plant guy.
voice change + trans = language change, basically perma muted but not that useful with pda messaging
NECROMETAB + SNEEZE = INVIS DISEASE SPREADING, stats start at: 0 1 1 4

cardboard golem = can use cardboard on self to reproduce?
